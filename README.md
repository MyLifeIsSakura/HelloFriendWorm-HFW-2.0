# HelloFriendWorm-HFW-2.0
This is a dangerous email worm and should be used for educational purposes only.
I am a worm and virus coder and this is my best work so far, the HelloFriend Worm AKA HFW AKA hello_friend.txt.vbs.

!!THIS IS FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES ONLY, I WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU FUCK UP AND USE THIS WORM INCORRECTLY!!

what de worm doing?:
When hello_friend.txt.vbs is ran, it infects all VBS and VBE files, it sets up multiple copies of itself to oviod termination
afterwards it makes a shortcut to your contacts and them all sends them this email:

Subject:HelloFriend

Body: hello my dear friend, please open the following attachment i sent you and dont make me uspet:(

Attachment: hello_friend.txt.vbs (a copy of the worm)

after you're computer has been used to spread it isnt "needed" anymore so the worm deletes all files from the c:/ root directory, and moves on.

Deeper info:
the worm ovoids detection by using confusing place holders and functions in its code, the worm is contained in a single file but when ran that file will create more
files that will be copies of the worm or files that help the worm run- your PC will be a worm making machine from then on out.
if requested i will give you guys a second encrypted copy which is basically
undetectable by antiviruses:)
